# ClientProcess.ai

**ClientProcess.ai** is a proof of concept built for Innovative Academy UGM's Innovation Challenge Batch 2025.
It leverages Google Gemini’s free API to simulate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, designed to help software houses accelerate the initial product requirement stage of the software development lifecycle.

✨ **Key Features**
- Translates client requirements into clear deliverables for PM, UX, and Dev teams
- Provides solutioning options with budget and resource forecasting
- Aligns multiple stakeholders through AI-generated Project Requirement Documents (PRDs)

⚙️ **How It Works**
- A client query is submitted.
- Relevant context documents (PM, UX, Dev, alignment) are retrieved.
- Gemini is prompted to generate a structured PRD output.
